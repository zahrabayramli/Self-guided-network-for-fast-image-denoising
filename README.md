# Self Guided Network for Fast Image Denoising
The PyTorch implementation of Self Guided Network (Shuhang Gu, Yawei Li , Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte. Self-Guided Network for Fast Image Denoising. ICCV, 2019)

You can train our implementation using SGN.ipynb (change the dataset path) which has all necessary network architecture, dataset and training codes. 

We also provide some of our results from DIV2K and Flickr2K datasets.
